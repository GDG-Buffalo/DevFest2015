  bio: "Geoffrey Challen leads the blue systems group (blue.cse.buffalo.edu), a shadowy and subversive group of systems designers and hackers located at the University at Buffalo, while also directing the PhoneLab Smartphone Platform Testbed (phone-lab.org). blue currently focuses on harnessing the power of the billions of deployed smartphones, which together comprise the largest distributed system ever built. He also teaches a partially-online course on computer operating systems. Somehow, he received both undergraduate and doctoral degrees from Harvard University, and in a misspent research youth worked with Matt Welsh deploying sensor networks on active volcanos."
